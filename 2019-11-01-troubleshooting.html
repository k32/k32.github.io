<h1 class="title">How to troubleshoot anything without a clue</h1>
<p>
In this post I want to share some techniques that I adopted over the
years of troubleshooting large distributed systems. This list will be
updated as I come up with more useful generalizations. Disclaimer:
this article is heavily focused on platform-level development, so it
may not be fully applicable to other areas of software engineering.
</p>

<p>
"In the ideal world this is absolutely impossible!", some of the
readers may exclaim in terror and disgust, "This is a bad
practice!". I will address their concerns in a chapter called "Have
zero trust in humanity".
</p>

<p>
Although the need to troubleshoot anything mostly arises as a
consequence of human imperfection, it can be seen from a more positive
perspective. Imagine that you're using an open source product that
lacks certain feature. You want to implement this feature, but how to
approach a large, unfamiliar code base? Some techniques described
below will help to navigate through the unknown code more quickly.
</p>

<h3 id="org"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Don't mess with the production</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
First and foremost: don't use debug tools in the production
environment. Debuggers or excessive logging put a lot of stress on the
system, so much so it will likely explode under normal traffic. There
are introspection tools that are <i>more or less</i> safe to use in a live
environment, but one should be careful with those too. I'll discuss
some of these tools below.
</p>

<p>
Logging in to a live system to run some sort of heavy debug job is
reckless enough already, but some large companies enforce even worse
practices.  Namely, they require developers to prepare a "debugging
runbook" for the ops team. Never agree to do this, unless you
personally supervise the process in real time. Here's why: suppose you
verified the instruction on a test node under simulated traffic, and
you know that it must finish in a couple seconds and the CPU load must
be so-and-so. Then you login to the production, and the same command
hangs for more than 10 seconds. You quickly realize that something
went horribly wrong, and use the last chance to abort the operation
before the server comes to a complete stop and your SSH session
dies. Another person won't react as quickly.

<h3 id="org"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Syslog is your debugger</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Learn how to debug without debugger. "Printf debugging" is considered
bad practice by some&#x2026; Lies. Whoever tells you that, wants to sell
you pro version of Visual Studio or something as useless. Truth is
that nowadays most serious systems are distributed. Stop-the-world
debugger that steps in and over functions won't work in the
distributed environment. Network sessions will time out and watchdog
will kill your service, if you try to stop it for debugging. And,
obviously, you can't stop a production system to debug a user request.

<h3 id="org"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Estimate urgency</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Impact of software issues varies from "batch job is delayed, and
quality of service is slowly declining" to "company is losing <code>$$$$/s</code>
<i>right now</i>". Depending on the situation, more aggressive
troubleshooting techniques become appropriate.

<div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Don't try to understand how things work</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
&#x2026;and focus on finding why they <i>don't work</i>.
</p>

<p>
Another big mistake: trying to understand the entire code
base. Typical enterprise system consists of hundreds KLOC, not
counting dependencies and the underlying stack. It was written by
dozens of engineers over the years, and it interacts with a few other
services. It's just not a fair match against a single person working
under time pressure.  If you try to find out why error happens by
following the code ("a function that crashes is called from here,
where data comes from there"), you'll get lost very
quickly<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. You can try this approach, and it <i>may</i> work with the
most obvious bugs, but keep in mind that its complexity grows
rapidly. If you find yourself looking through more than, say, 5 source
code files at the same time, consider switching to more clever
techniques described below.
</p>

<p>
Understanding how the system works <i>will</i> be required later, when you
work on a "proper" solution, but during the peak firefighting stage
this knowledge is unobtainable, so you need to be prepared to perform
surgery without a clue.

<h3 id="org"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Differential troubleshooting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
I find this technique absolutely essential for dealing with fires in
the companies' attics. It is simple, but exceedingly efficient. In
short, it's a way of reasoning based around questions:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Anomaly was reported at 10am, what log messages appeared (or
disappeared) around this time?</li>
<li>It worked before release R, and it doesn't work now. What is the
delta of the release R?</li>
<li>It works with data A, but not data B. What is the delta between
requests A and B?</li>
<li>&#x2026;</li>
</ol>

<p>
In other words, you need to find how the anomaly <i>changes</i> the
behavior of the system. The more specific your questions become, the
smaller is your search space. Your goal is to narrow down the
difference between working and broken state of the system to the
smallest possible set.
</p>

<p>
Importance of this method is based on the assumption that any
production system is <i>mostly</i> correct in a sense that it exhibits
somewhat sane behavior in 90% of cases. If it was more broken than
that, nobody would expect it to work in the first place. Therefore,
trying to find an error simply by following the common code path is
fruitless, because this code path is <i>most likely</i> correct.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Bisection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Typically requests have to travel through lots of individual services,
message brokers, functions and layers of abstraction. As usual,
bisection is the quickest method of pinpointing the place in the code
that corrupts the data. Instead of following the request from the
gateway proxy to the database, try to find what's going on
approximately in the middle between them. Is data already corrupted
there?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Surprisal maximization</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Wikipedia gives the following definition of surprisal:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The information content (also called the surprisal) of an event <code>E</code> is
a function which decreases as the probability <code>p(E)</code> of an event
increases.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When analyzing a broken request, or broken data, or broken code, try
finding the most distinct ("surprisal") part of it. Suppose you're
looking at some problematic data similar to this:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-right" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">id</td>
<td class="org-right">345637</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">code</td>
<td class="org-right">3</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">errandno</td>
<td class="org-right">6422</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Grepping project sources for the field name "code" will likely yield
thousands of results. Searching for "id" will probably yield even
more. On the other hand, "errandno" field (whatever it means doesn't
matter) is pretty uncommon. It's not even an English word, which makes
it even better for our purposes. Search for "errandno" in the
company's source code index and you will likely find just 3 or 4
entries. One of them will point at the origin of the wrong data. Now
what about integer values? Searching for 3 in the logs will give you
millions of irrelevant results. So start from looking for
value 345637.
</p>

<p>
I hope this example makes the idea pretty clear.

Tcpdump is more or less safe to use in production (YMMV), but you must

and don't print captured packets to the console attached by SSH,
unless you want to explore limits of infinite recursion.

If you find yourself dismissing some idea because your inner voice
says "well, this would be too obvious" or "no one could do something
like this", chances are that actually you are onto something. After
seeing bugs that no person should see, I conclude with all confidence,
that our industry is absolutely cursed. Self-made autodidacts and
university graduates alike have no idea how to do things. Putting your
trust in software engineer's ability to do something sane is like
expecting compensation from the Nigerian prince you helped to liberate
with the help of your new pen-friend.
</p>

<p>
This raises a question: if nothing can be trusted, how to avoid
depth-first'ing into your entire OS and hardware stack? The answer
lies in differential troubleshooting technique described above. You
can suspect a bug in Linux. But if you do, it means the bug should
manifest not only in your business application, but in all other
processes running on the same host. If you don't observe anomalies in
the other processes, OS bug is less likely than application
bug. Bisection technique is also useful: if you suspect a Linux kernel
bug, run strace to find if data that goes into the kernel is valid
(most likely you will find that it's not).
</p>

<p>
If you know OS and networking level well enough, and you practice
differential troubleshooting routine, your brain can generate and
dismiss potential failure scenarios in split second, so suspecting
services and libraries outside your own is not as time-consuming as
one may think.

Any bug is a cakewalk, when it concerns a system that you actively
develop. But I bet your company has Great Old Ones: systems that work
largely unnoticed, until they break. And things get much spicier when
you first learn about such system from a bug report with URGENT!
headline.
</p>

<p>
I know, I know, situation like this could <i>never</i> happen in the ideal
world. But if you're reading this post, then your plane of existence
intersects with mine. Be wary: in a hellish place that I inhibit,
people retire, change teams, and there are 10x rock star ninja
evangelists who develop something in spite of architect's advice just
to put it on their résumé and hop onto a next job. If you receive a
trouble report related to one of these systems, and have no idea what
it does and where it lives, don't worry too much. There is a person
who knows that: the one who submitted the bug report. Interrogate them
until you find some entry points towards the system. Learn hostnames,
keywords, what is the expected behavior, what behavior is unexpected,
and so forth. Then use source code index and all the techniques
described above.
</p>

<p>
P.S. If you find yourself solving this kind of problem, don't forget
to look around and check if you're the last person left in the
office. Consider tactical retreat in the direction of job market.

This knowledge may ruin your life. If you master these techniques,

fires non-stop.
</p>

<p>
The best way to apply your troubleshooting skills is by developing new
systems, rather than keeping legacy code on life support. Most
appropriate time for bug hunting is <i>before</i> the software goes
live. Good troubleshooters make the best programmers, because they
learned from others' mistakes. They tend to design systems that are
more resilient to failure, and that are easier to troubleshoot. They
intuitively see scenarios that should be covered by tests. They
learned negative, pessimistic way of thinking, that is essential for
any platform-layer designer. Conversely, any person who can't
troubleshoot systems, can't be trusted to write platform-level code.
</p>

<p>
Please note that I don't encourage you to program defensively, but
instead:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Separate systems that should have AAA reliability from the systems
those code should be able to mutate quickly due to business
requirements</li>
<li>Write good tests</li>
<li>Design systems that have redundancy</li>
<li>Design systems that are fail-safe</li>
<li>Employ good deployment practices, like green/blue deployments</li>
<li>Keep it simple, stupid. When you write a line of code, imagine that
someone has to troubleshoot it at 4 am, and they are good at
this. Which is to say, they <i>will</i> find where you live.</li>
