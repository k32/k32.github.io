<h1 class="title">This messenger respects your privacy</h1>
<p>
Today I want to introduce Acme, a new instant messenger with E2E
encryption and blast processing, that respects your privacy! It's not
just for everyone, it is specifically targeted towards journalists who
need to communicate with their sources, dissidents and other people
<del>whose metadata and social graph is especially interesting to
honeypot</del> in need of strong privacy. Forget about obsolete
decentralized stuff like GPG, and install AcmeIM from Grahma Play
Store today.

<p>
Unlike obsolete encryption systems, we require mobile phone to
register in our system. Your account is tied to your phone
number. Never mind that in many countries around the world SIM-cards
can be bought only after presenting a legal ID, and that mobile
networks themselves have all-encompassing LI (Lawful Interception)
interfaces by design. Also let's ignore the fact that mobile networks
still heavily rely on SS7 protocol stack from the 70s, with the
security model based on gentlemen's agreement. Some people claim that
words "mobile network" and "secure" can't be used in the same
sentence, but our security experts think it's very safe. Do you guys
not have phones?

Our messenger uses client-server approach. (You can't run your own
server, BTW.) This allows us to iterate faster than the obsolete
p2p/federated networks. We promise not to store any metadata on our
servers. Remember, end-to-end encryption = safe.

<h2 id="org53d9200"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Grahma play store</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
You can only download the client from the Grahma play store, so we can
iterate faster. Grahma inc. is the champion of privacy and freedom, so
we heavily rely on their APIs as well. It also helps us to update Acme
client automatically. Suppose some so-called experts "audited" certain
version of Acme. By doing that, they basically invited users to stick
to the old version and hinder our ability to evolve, and put our users
in risk. So we don't allow that.
</p>

<p>
P.S. Grahma and friends <i>certainly</i> don't have the list of apps
running on your phone, so it's safe to install AcmeIM without drawing
any attention.

<p>
There are old cryptography tools that don't need centralized server,
or mobile phone. They are modular enough, so the cyphertext can be
embedded in DCT coefficients of cat pictures posted on @channel. In
the current year this approach is a joke. It is extremely user
unfriendly.
</p>

<p>
Security experts proclaim these old tools obsolete and can't wait
until they die. Don't use them and download AcmeIM today!
