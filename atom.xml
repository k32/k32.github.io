  <title>Trace-based testing</title>
  <description><![CDATA[<div id="content">

 <p>
Almost every practical algorithm is non-deterministic by
design. Unpredictable process scheduling has to be dealt with in
concurrent programs, network reorders and delays messages randomly,
and fault-tolerant systems can experience failover at any time. It
comes as no surprise to anyone, and most programmers deal with
non-determinism on subconscious level. Tests, on the other hand, often
ignore or fight this property, which becomes a constant supply of
flakiness.
</p>

 <p>
In this post I want to introduce a simple component <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> test  <a href="https://github.com/klarna/snabbkaffe">library</a>
that tries to embrace non-determinism, or at least live with it. It
achieves this by giving up on  <i>states</i> and focusing on temporal
relations of  <i>effects</i> instead: relevant side effects of the algorithm
are recorded into a  <i>trace</i>, which later gets analyzed for desired
properties. Simply speaking, testcase reads the logs of system under
test (SUT) in order to find bugs. As a bonus, tests written in this
style tend to scale better than traditional ones, in theory and in my
own experience.
</p>

 <p>
The idea of using an event trace for verifying properties of
concurrent (and distributed) systems is far from new, but it is rather
uncommon outside of academia. I will also touch on how trace-based
testing compares with more traditional approaches such as stateful
property-based testing.
</p>

 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-2">
 <h2 id="org"> <span class="section-number-2">1</span> Conventional approach</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
 <p>
Typical component test usually follows the same common scenario: first
a clean test environment is created. This probably involves spinning
up Docker containers, initializing tables with test data and so
on. Sometimes a testcase mocks functions that are of particular
interest, and injects checks inside these mocks. Then a SUT is
started. In the simplest case it happens synchronously, but often the
testcase has to wait for the steady state by probing, sleeping and
retrying.
</p>

 <p>
After startup is done, actual testing can finally begin. This part
consists of one or multiple iterations of stimulating the system (via
an API call or error injection), followed by checking that it responds
to the stimuli as expected. The checking part may again require
probing and retrying. It may also involve analyzing data captured by
the mocks.
</p>

 <p>
Finally a cleanup stage is run, but it is not that interesting. The
below pseudocode illustrates the entire workflow:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">

 <p>
This basic testing loop can be put together with varying degrees of
fanciness, up to stateful  <a href="https://proper-testing.github.io/">PropER</a> models, but it doesn't change the
core mechanic described above.
</p>

 <p>
So, what is wrong about this basic and familiar design?
</p>
</div>

 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org"> <span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Scalability</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
 <p>
First problem is run time. Obviously, one wants to verify as many
different properties as possible. But a complex SUT may require a
complex test environment, which can take arbitrarily long time to set
up. (Anecdotally, I used to work with a Common Test suite where
 <code>init_per_testcase</code> callback took a few minutes. The experience was
soul-crushing.) Typical response to this challenge, naturally,
involves trying to cram as many scenarios into the testcase as
possible. Then comes realization that the testcase becomes extremely
hard to understand, troubleshoot and extend.
</p>

 <p>
In my experience, there are multiple reasons for this:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>State deviates too much from the blank slate. Each operation can
mutate state of the SUT, and the following checks have to take more
and more history into account. Stateful propER suites mitigate this
problem by managing model state automatically, but it comes at a
significant cost of having to define an elaborate and complete
model of the system.</li>
 <li> <p>
Non-determinism starts crawling out a closet. Typical test starts
from a known state, and tries to evolve it in extremely controlled
fashion, to avoid dealing with multiple outcomes, because there
lies combinatorial explosion and loss of sanity.
</p>

 <p>
But natural sources of randomness, that exist in any complex
system, tend to sneak into the results more and more over time. As
far as I know, stateful propERties can't deal with this, as model
state is evolved via symbolic execution that happens before SUT is
even started.
</p>

 <p>
This leads to testcase flakiness or unreasonably long waiting until
the system stabilizes.
</p></li>
 <li>Mocks are not composable. If checks are injected into SUT using
mock functions, it becomes exceedingly hard to add new checks.</li>
</ol> <p>
Conclusion: efficiency of testing could be greatly improved if there
was an easy way to validate multiple properties without re-running
test scenarios. Trace-based approach solves this problem, because an
event trace can be recorded once and analyzed however many times.

 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org"> <span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Error detection</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
 <p>
"Retry N times until test condition becomes true and call it a pass"
is a pretty common pattern found in tests. Although it works
reasonably well most of the time, there are kinds of errors that evade
it: livelocks for example. During livelock condition the system may
enter "valid" state temporarily, and the testcase designed via retry
logic may accept it.
</p>

 <p>
To illustrate how bad it can be, imagine a distributed system
consisting of two nodes, where automatic failover can happen. Each
node can reside in three possible states, let's call them  <code>primary</code>,
 <code>standby</code> and  <code>alone</code>. During normal operation there is one  <code>primary</code>
and one  <code>standby</code> node. The  <code>primary</code> instance may fail, in which case
the other node changes its state from  <code>standby</code> to  <code>alone</code>, and takes
over the workload. When the failed node recovers, it enters  <code>standby</code>
state and signals to its partner that it's ready, then the latter
enters  <code>primary</code> state, and the system becomes redundant again. Now
suppose there is a bug, that is triggered shortly after state
transition from  <code>alone</code> to  <code>primary</code> happens. It can lead to a
situation where failover becomes cyclic. "Retry until first success"
approach will let this error slip through, but this error can be
trivially detected in a trace-based test by counting failover events.

The below (incomplete!) list contains some examples of libraries using

 <h3 id="org"> <span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Introducing Snabbkaffe</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
 <p>
 <a href="https://github.com/klarna/snabbkaffe">Snabbkaffe</a> is a small Erlang application inspired by the above
libraries. Above all, it tries to be accessible and compatible with
other test frameworks, such as Common Test and PropER. It is not
rigorous <sup> <a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>: it can find bugs, but it cannot verify absence of
errors.
</p>
</div>

 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org"> <span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Instrumenting the code</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
 <p>
Trace points are added to the code manually using  <code>?tp</code> macro:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-erlang">? <span style="color: #8ae234;">tp</span>(something_happened, #{ param1 =>  <span style="color: #ad7fa8; font-style: italic;">"Something"</span>
                         , param2 => 217
                         })
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
The above line of code, when compiled in test mode, emits an event of
kind  <code>something_happened</code>, with some additional data specified in the
second argument. Any event has a kind, which is an atom identifying
type of the event. The second argument must be a map that can contain
anything.
</p>

 <p>
Exact form of this effect captured in the trace will look like this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-erlang">#{ kind   => something_happened
 , param1 =>  <span style="color: #ad7fa8; font-style: italic;">"Something"</span>
 , param2 => 217
 , ts     => .....  <span style="color: #888a85;">% </span> <span style="color: #888a85;">native timestamp</span>
 }
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
In the release build this macro will become a  <a href="https://github.com/tolbrino/hut">hut</a> log message with
debug level. Log level can be tuned with a special form of  <code>?tp</code> macro
that takes 3 arguments:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-erlang">? <span style="color: #8ae234;">tp</span>(notice, something_happened, #{ param1 =>  <span style="color: #ad7fa8; font-style: italic;">"Something"</span>
                                 , param2 => 217
                                 , ...
                                 })
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
…Quite literally, snabbkaffe analyzes the logs of the SUT.
</p>

 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org"> <span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Structure of the testcase</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
 <p>
In order to address scalability issue mentioned above, snabbkaffe
decouples execution of test scenario from the checks. Testcases are
split in two parts:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li> <b>Run stage</b> where the program runs and emits an event trace</li>
 <li> <b>Check stage</b> where the trace is collected and validated against
the spec(s)</li>
</ul> <p>
To save user from boilerplate of starting  <code>snabbkaffe_collector</code> and
collecting the trace,  <code>?check_trace</code> macro is defined, that takes care
of these steps:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-erlang">? <span style="color: #8ae234;">check_trace</span>( <span style="color: #729fcf; font-weight: bold;">begin</span>
                <span style="color: #888a85;">%% </span> <span style="color: #888a85;">Run stage:</span>
                <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Result</span>
              <span style="color: #729fcf; font-weight: bold;">end</span>,
              <span style="color: #729fcf; font-weight: bold;">fun</span>( <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Result</span>,  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Trace</span>) ->
                 <span style="color: #888a85;">%% </span> <span style="color: #888a85;">Check stage:</span>
                 <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">CheckStage</span>
              <span style="color: #729fcf; font-weight: bold;">end</span>).
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Return value of the run stage is passed to the check stage function
together with the collected trace.
</p>

 <p>
There is also an extended version of this macro, that passes some
additional options to  <code>snabbkaffe_collector</code>:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-erlang">? <span style="color: #8ae234;">check_trace</span>(#{timeout =>  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Timeout</span>},
              <span style="color: #729fcf; font-weight: bold;">begin</span>
                <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">RunStage</span>
              <span style="color: #729fcf; font-weight: bold;">end</span>,
              <span style="color: #729fcf; font-weight: bold;">fun</span>( <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">ReturnValue</span>,  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Trace</span>) ->
                 <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">CheckStage</span>
              <span style="color: #729fcf; font-weight: bold;">end</span>).
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
 <code>timeout</code> commands collector process to wait for a set period of
silence before terminating. It might be useful sometimes, although
depending on timeouts opens road to flakiness. There are a few other
parameters that are out of scope of this post.
</p>
</div>
</div>

 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org"> <span class="section-number-3">2.5</span> Analyzing the trace</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
 <p>
Remember that trace analysis is done offline, so any pure function can
be used for this task. Snabbakaffe comes with a few useful functions
and macros.
</p>

 <p>
Let's begin from my favorite one, called  <code>?strict_causality</code>. It
verifies that any event matching pattern  <code>Cause</code>, is followed by
exactly one event that matches pattern  <code>Effect</code>. It can be used to
encode "something results in another thing" type of properties, here's
just a few examples:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Every external request entering the system eventually gets
processed</li>
 <li>Killing a node results in failover</li>
</ul> <p>
Consider an example:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-erlang">? <span style="color: #8ae234;">strict_causality</span>( #{kind := request, req_id :=  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">_Ref</span>}  <span style="color: #888a85;">%% </span> <span style="color: #888a85;">Cause</span>
                 , #{kind := reply,   req_id :=  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">_Ref</span>}  <span style="color: #888a85;">%% </span> <span style="color: #888a85;">Effect</span>
                 ,  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Trace</span>
                 )
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
 <code>Cause</code> expression binds variables used in  <code>Effect</code> expression, so the
above code reads as "for each request with request id equal to  <code>_Ref</code>
there should be a reply with the same id".
</p>

 <p>
There is also a sister macro that allows  <code>Cause</code> without  <code>Effect</code> (but
not vice versa), called  <code>?causality</code>. It works similarly, although it
is used less often. Both  <code>?strict_causality</code> and  <code>?causality</code> are
based on the same powerful macro called  <code>?find_pairs</code>:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-erlang">? <span style="color: #8ae234;">find_pairs</span>( <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Strict</span>,  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Cause</span>,  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Effect</span> [,  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Guard</span>],  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Trace</span>)
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Where  <code>Cause</code> and  <code>Effect</code> are pattern match expressions,  <code>Guard</code> is
an optional predicate that allows to refine cause/effect matching, and
 <code>Strict</code> is a boolean defining whether or not effects without a cause
are allowed. This macro returns a list of pairs of complimentary
events and singletons, that can be further analyzed, for example using
 <code>?pair_max_depth</code> macro, which returns maximal nesting level. This can
be used e.g. to verify semaphore-like systems.
</p>

 <p>
A few helper macros for extracting relevant data from the trace
deserve mention too.  <code>?of_kind([kind1, kind2, ...], Trace)</code>,
unsurprisingly, filters events with certain
kinds.  <code>?projection([field1, field2, ...], Trace)</code> extracts fields
from events to make data more manageable.
</p>

 <p>
 <code>?projection_complete</code> and  <code>?projection_is_subset</code> macros check if
values of a field form a superset or a subset of a known
set.  <code>snabbkaffe:unique/1</code> function checks that there are no duplicate
events.
</p>

 <p>
In general it is advised to factor complex properties into small
manageable functions, like in the below example (taken from a real
project and stripped of irrelevant details):
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">

Run stage often needs to wait for something to happen. This can be
needed, for example, when some part of the system is activated
asynchronously. Retry loop will still work, of course, but sometimes
it's more convenient to wait for a certain trace event.  <code>?block_until</code>

 <code>?block_until</code> macro works like this: first it tries to find an event
in the history, going at most  <code>BackInTime</code> milliseconds into the
past. If this succeeds, execution continues immediately, otherwise
calling process gets blocked until the event arrives or crashes after
timeout.
</p>

 <p>
Although this macro can cover most scenarios, tuning two timings may
be tricky and error-prone. There is a more "atomic" version of this
macro, named  <code>?wait_async_action</code>, which doesn't have to look into the
past:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-erlang">? <span style="color: #8ae234;">wait_async_action</span>( <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Action</span>,  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Match</span>,  <span style="color: #eeeeaa;">Timeout</span>)
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
It starts waiting for  <code>Action</code>'s expected outcome event  <code>Match</code> before
running it.
</p>
</div>

 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
 <p>
Snabbkaffe works nicely with PropER.  <code>?check_trace</code> macro can be used
to define stateless properties, and there is, in fact, a shortcut for
the most common way of doing this:  <code>?forall_trace</code>. But when it comes
to stateful properties, things get more interesting on the
philosophical layer.
</p>

 <p>
Stateful property based testing is an object of pride in the Erlang
community, and rightfully so. Nonetheless, I would argue that
trace-based approach is more efficient in the majority of cases. First
of all, remember that snabbkaffe strives to eliminate the state from
the equation and focus on effects. This makes trace-based and stateful
property-based testing almost mutually exclusive. For black-box and
gray-box testing <sup> <a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>, side effects is all what matters, so
snabbkaffe fills this niche. On the other hand, stateful properties
are much better at increasing test coverage.

  <title>How to troubleshoot anything without a clue</title>
  <description><![CDATA[<div id="content">

 <p>
In this post I want to share some techniques that I developed over the
years of troubleshooting large systems. This list will be updated when
I come up with more useful generalizations.
</p>

 <p>
"In the ideal world this is absolutely impossible!", some of the
readers may exclaim in terror and disgust, "This is a bad
practice!". I will address this in a chapter called "Have zero trust
in humanity".
</p>

 <p>
Although in most cases troubleshooting is a consequence of human
imperfection, you can approach it from a more positive
perspective. Imagine you use an opensource product that lacks a
feature you want. You want to implement this feature, but where to
begin? Techniques described below will help to navigate through
unfamiliar code bases quickly.
</p>

 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-2">
 <h2 id="org"> <span class="section-number-2">1</span> Essential dos and don'ts</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
</div>
 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org"> <span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Don't debug in production</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
 <p>
First and foremost: don't use debug tools in the production
environment. Debuggers or excessive logging put a lot of stress on the
system, so much so it will likely explode under high traffic. There
are introspection tools that are  <i>more or less</i> safe to use in a live
environment, but one should be careful with those too. I'll discuss
some of these tools below.
</p>

 <p>
Logging in to a live system to run a debug command is reckless enough
already, but preparing an instruction for an ops team how to do it,
should be absolutely out of question! Suppose you verified the
instruction on a test node, so you know that it finishes in a couple
seconds. Then you login to production, and the same command hangs for
more than 10 seconds. You realize that you screwed up somewhere, and
may have a chance to abort operation before SSH session dies. The
other person won't react as quickly.
</p>
</div>
</div>

 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org"> <span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Don't try to understand how things work</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
 <p>
…and focus on why they don't work.
</p>

 <p>
Second big mistake: don't try to understand the entire code
base. Typical enterprise system consists of hundreds KLOC not counting
dependencies and the underlying stack, it was written by dozens of
engineers over the years, and it interacts with a few other
systems. It's just not a fair match against a single person working
under time pressure.  If you try to find out why error happens by
following the code ("a function that crashes is called from here,
where data comes from there"), you'll get lost very quickly. You can
try this approach, and it  <i>may</i> work with the most obvious bugs, but
keep in mind that its complexity grows exponentially. If you find
yourself looking through more than, say, 3 source code files at the
same time, consider switching to more clever techniques described
below.
</p>

 <p>
Understanding how the system works  <i>will</i> be required later, when you
work on a "proper" solution, but during peak firefighting stage this
knowledge is unobtainable, so you need to be prepared to perform on
stage without a clue.
</p>
</div>

 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org"> <span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Estimate urgency</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
 <p>
Impact of software issues varies from "batch job is delayed, and
quality of service is slowly declining" to "company is losing  <code>$$$$/s</code>
 <i>right now</i>". Depending on the situation, more aggressive
troubleshooting techniques become appropriate.
</p>
</div>
</div>

 <div id="outline-container-org" class="outline-3">
 <h3 id="org"> <span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Have they tried turning it off and on?</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
 <p>
Don't underestimate the importance of "fixing bugs by
power-cycling". The ops team needs the runbooks describing how (and
when) to restart the misbehaving node.

 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
 <p>
This technique is absolutely essential. It is simple, but exceedingly
efficient. In short, it's a way of reasoning based around questions:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Anomaly was reported at 10am, what log messages appeared (or
disappeared) around this time?</li>
 <li>It worked before release R, and it doesn't work now. What was in
the release R?</li>
 <li>It works with data A, but not data B. What is the difference
between A and B?</li>
</ul> <p>
In other words, you need to find how does an anomaly  <i>change</i> the
behavior of the system. The more specific your questions become, the
smaller is your search space. Your goal is to narrow down the
difference between working and broken state of the system to the
smallest possible set.
</p>

 <p>
Importance of this method is based on an assumption that any
production system is  <i>mostly</i> correct in a sense that it exhibits
somewhat sane behavior in 90% of cases. If it was just broken through
and thorough, it wouldn't have survived, and nobody wouldn't have
missed it. Therefore trying to find an error simply by following the
common code path is fruitless, because this code path is  <i>most likely</i>
correct.

If you find yourself dismissing some idea because of "well, this would
be too obvious" or "no, this is absolutely impossible" reasons,
chances are that actually you are onto something. After seeing bugs
that no person should see, I conclude with all confidence, that our
industry is absolutely cursed. No one has any idea how to do
things. Putting your trust in our ability to do anything sane is like
lending your wallet to a bunch of thugs.
</p>

 <p>
This raises a question: if nothing can be trusted, how to avoid
depth-first'ing the entire OS and hardware stack? The answer lies in
differential troubleshooting technique described above. You can
suspect a bug in Linux. But if you do so, it means the bug should
manifest not only in your business application, but in all processes
running on the same host. If you don't observe anomalies in the other
processes, OS bug is less likely than application bug. Bisection is
also useful: if you suspect a Linux kernel bug, run strace to find if
data that goes into the kernel is valid (most likely you will find
that it's not).
</p>

 <p>
If you know OS and networking level well enough, and you practice
differential troubleshooting routine, your brain can generate and
dismiss potential failure scenarios in split second, so suspecting
services and libraries outside of your own is not as time-consuming as
one may think.

 <p>
When nothing works, try to get some company. Worst thing that can
happen is when you panic and stop trying new ideas. This happens even
to the best of us. Brainstorming helps a lot, but just having a
friendly chat, while something is burning, helps people staying
productive.

 <p>
Any bug is a cakewalk, when it concerns a system that you actively
work on. But I bet your company has a quite a few Great Old Ones
sleeping underneath Jira. And things get much more picante when
you first hear about such system from a bug report.
</p>

 <p>
I know, I know, situation like this could  <i>never</i> happen in the ideal
world. But if you're reading this post, then your plane of existence
intersects with mine. Be wary: in hellish place that I inhibit, people
retire, change teams, and there are 10x rockstar ninja wizards who
develop something just to put it on their resumé and hop onto a next
job. If you receive a trouble report related to one of these systems,
and have no idea what it does and where it lives, don't worry too
much. There is a person who knows that: one who submitted the bug
report. Interrogate them until you find some entry points towards the
system. Learn hostnames, keywords, what is the expected behavior, what
behavior is unexpected, and so on. Then use source code index and all the
techniques described above.
</p>

 <p>
P.S. If you find yourself solving this kind of problem often, look
around and check if you're the last person left in the
office. Consider tactical retreat towards the job market.

 <p>
Search space is a Cartesian product of

 <p>
This knowledge will ruin your life. If you master these techniques,
don't let anyone know.
</p>

 <p>
The best way to apply your troubleshooting skills is by developing new
systems, rather than keeping legacy code on life support. Most
appropriate time for bug hunting is  <i>before</i> the software goes
live. Good troubleshooters make the best programmers, because they
learned from others' mistakes. They tend to design systems that are
more resilient to failure, and that are easier to troubleshoot. They
intuitively see scenarios that should be covered by tests. They
learned negative, pessimistic way of thinking, that is essential for
any platform-layer designer.
</p>

 <p>
Note that I don't encourage you to program defensively, instead:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Separate systems that should have AAA reliability from the systems
those code should be able to mutate quickly following business
processes</li>
 <li>Design systems that have redundancy</li>
 <li>Design systems that fail safe</li>
 <li>Employ good deployment practices</li>
 <li>Keep it simple, stupid. When you write a line of code, imagine that
someone has to troubleshoot it at 4 am, and they are good at
this. Which means they  <i>will</i> find your hideout</li>
</ul></div>
